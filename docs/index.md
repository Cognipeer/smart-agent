# Smart Agent

Lightweight loop-based agent with planning, tool limits, and context summarization (no LangGraph dependency).

- Fast to integrate: a single factory to create your agent.
- Safe by design: planning mode, tool call caps, and token-aware summarization.
- Great DX: built-in logging and structured outputs.
